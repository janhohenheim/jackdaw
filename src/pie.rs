//! Play-In-Editor runtime.
//!
//! Jackdaw hosts a game's systems in its own `App` (same World,
//! not a `SubApp`). Games are dylibs loaded at startup via the
//! `jackdaw_game_entry_v1` FFI symbol; their `build(&mut App)`
//! callback registers systems into the editor's schedule. Game
//! systems gate their execution on [`PlayState::Playing`] so they
//! only tick when the user has Play engaged.
//!
//! This module provides:
//! - [`PlayState`] — the `Stopped` / `Playing` / `Paused` state.
//! - [`PrePlayScene`] — scene AST snapshot captured at Play time,
//!   restored on Stop so the authored scene is the revert baseline.
//! - [`PieButton`] — marker component for the toolbar transport
//!   buttons; the `PiePlugin` auto-wires a click observer to each.
//! - [`GameSpawned`] — marker added automatically to any entity that
//!   receives a `Transform` during `PlayState::Playing`. Editor
//!   surfaces (hierarchy, inspector) use it to distinguish
//!   authored-then-played entities from ones the game spawned.
//! - [`PiePlugin`] — registers state, resource, and observers.
//!
//! Handlers [`handle_play`], [`handle_pause`], [`handle_stop`] are
//! exposed for direct `commands.queue(...)` use in case other
//! surfaces (keybinds, menu entries) want to trigger PIE
//! transitions without going through a button.
